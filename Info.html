        <h3>General Information</h3>
    <p>Sspace provides Wellesley College students with safe night locations that they can go to. You can navigate the 
application through the main nav bar below. The first page is a map, where you can see the rating of places around your current location and click on them to access their pages. The second page is the "You" page, where you can see past comments that you have made. The third page allows you to see all the locations ranked by their safe score/rating and you can search through them. The fourth and last page allows you to find out more about the app.
