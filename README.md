SafeSpace, date: 2015 

Project for CS220: This was the final project for CS220, "Human Computer Interaction" at Wellesley College. My team and I designed, programed, and tested a mobile user interface for iOS. We used JavaScript, JQuery, CSS, and HTML to create a platform for sharing safety reviews and concerns of different off campus social settings around Boston. Coded only the frontend; no backend database implementation.

This is a native mobile application for iOS. This application has not been updated from 2015. Requires to run it through a server. To test a working version of the application, go to: http://cs.wellesley.edu/~css4/SafeNight/profile.html
